# What is a Token Lifecycle?

A token lifecycle describes the key events a financial asset undergoes when it is digitised and managed on-chain. In traditional finance, an asset like a bond or derivative goes through stages such as issuance, settlement, redemption, and reporting. When tokenised, each of these stages corresponds to specific on-chain actions using tokens.

## Key Stages

- **Minting**: The digital creation of a token to represent the asset.
- **Transfer**: The movement of the token between parties (e.g., trade settlement).
- **Burning**: Destruction of the token when the asset is redeemed, cancelled, or matured.
- **Balance Checking**: Verifying token holdings for reconciliation, auditing, or regulatory compliance.
