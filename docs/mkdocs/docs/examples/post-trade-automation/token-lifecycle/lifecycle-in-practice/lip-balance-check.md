# 4. Balance Check

| Section               | Details  |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| **What happens**       | You verify the number of tokens held in a given wallet. This is often used for reconciliation (e.g., matching on-chain holdings with off-chain records), reporting, or internal audits. |
| **Real-world analogy** | A custodian verifies that Client X holds 100 units of a particular bond in their account. |
| **API**                | [`GET /api/tokens/balance`](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/references/api/api-check-token-balance/) |
| **Code Example**       | [How to check token balances](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/how-tos/how-to-check-a-token-balance/) |

**Example Endpoint (GET):**

```bash
/api/tokens/balance?asset_id=UKGILT2030&wallet_address=0xA1B2...
```
