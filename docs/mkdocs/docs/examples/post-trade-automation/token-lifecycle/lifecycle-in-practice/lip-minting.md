# 1. Minting


| Section               | Details  |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| **What happens**       | A new token is created to represent the financial asset. This happens at the point of asset issuance or contract creation.                  |
| **Real-world analogy** | Issuing a bond certificate and recording it in a central ledger. Here, you're issuing a digital version on a blockchain.                   |
| **API**                | [`POST /api/tokens/mint`](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/references/api/api-mint-token/) |
| **Code Example**       | [How to mint a token](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/how-tos/how-to-mint-a-token/) |



**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "asset_id": "UKGILT2030",
  "amount": 100,
  "recipient_wallet_address": "0xABC123..."
}
```
