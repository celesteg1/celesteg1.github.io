# Why Tokenisation Matters

Tokenising financial assets enables benefits such as:

- **Transparency:** Every token action is recorded on-chain.
- **Automation:** APIs enable seamless post-trade processes.
- **Fractional Ownership:** Tokens can represent fractional claims to assets.
- **Improved Liquidity:** Tokens can be transferred more easily between parties, even across platforms.
