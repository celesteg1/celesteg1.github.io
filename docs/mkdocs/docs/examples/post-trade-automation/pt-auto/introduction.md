In capital markets, executing a trade is just the first step. What follows (post-trade processing) is often complex, fragmented, and costly. Traditionally, it involves a web of intermediaries, disconnected systems, and settlement delays.

Today, however, the financial infrastructure is evolving. Technologies like tokenisation and API-driven automation are streamlining the way assets are issued, transferred, and managed. This promises faster, more efficient post-trade workflows.

!!! tip
    If you're building on our platform, also see the [Token Lifecycle](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/token-lifecycle/what-is-a-token-lifecycle/) and [Getting Started](/mkdocs/examples/overview/#outline-of-docs) documentation for sandbox access and production integration.

!!! question "**New to tokenisation?**"
    We’ve prepared a brief explainer of key concepts such as tokenisation, smart contracts, and distributed validation. [Read the Glossary of Key Concepts](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/references/glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms/).
