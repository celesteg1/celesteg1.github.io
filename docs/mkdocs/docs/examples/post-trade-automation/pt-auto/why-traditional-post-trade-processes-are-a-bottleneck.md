# Why Traditional Post-Trade Processes Are a Bottleneck

Once a trade is agreed between two parties, several steps follow before final ownership is confirmed:

1. **Trade Confirmation & Matching**: Both parties validate that trade terms align.
2. **Clearing**: A central counterparty (CCP) manages settlement risk.
3. **Settlement**: Cash and assets are exchanged, often via custodians.
4. **Custody & Ownership Recording**: Final ownership is registered with custodians or central securities depositories (CSDs).
5. **Reconciliation & Reporting**: Institutions align records and report trades to regulators.

These steps are often handled by different systems and intermediaries, leading to:

- Settlement delays (T+2 or longer)
- High reconciliation and operational overhead
- Increased compliance costs
- Reduced transparency
