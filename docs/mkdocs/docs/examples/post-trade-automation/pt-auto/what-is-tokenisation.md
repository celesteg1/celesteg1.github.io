# What is Tokenisation?

**Tokenisation** is the process of converting real-world financial instruments (e.g. bonds, swaps, structured products) into **digital tokens** that live on a blockchain or distributed ledger.

Each token is a **digital twin** of the real-world asset. It reflects the asset’s legal, financial, and operational terms, yet can be issued, transferred, and retired digitally.

Think of tokenisation as the digital equivalent of issuing bearer instruments, but programmable, traceable, and auditable by design.

For example:

 - A traditional bond might be tracked by a custodian’s database.
 - A **tokenised bond** can be minted on-chain, transferred peer-to-peer, split into fractions, or burned, all with full transparency and rule-based automation.
