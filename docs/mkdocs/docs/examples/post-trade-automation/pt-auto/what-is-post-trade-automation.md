Post-trade automation uses software, APIs, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to digitise and streamline post-trade steps.

Instead of relying on legacy infrastructure, automation allows:

- Real-time asset transfer and ownership updates
- Pre-programmed workflows for settlement and maturity
- Instant reconciliation via shared ledgers
- Fully traceable actions via audit-ready APIs

In this model, APIs become the new rails, handling trade confirmations, settlements, redemptions, and reconciliations digitally, with minimal manual input.



Below is a comparison between traditional post-trade activities and automated post-trade activities:

| Step                  | Traditional Post-Trade                                                                 | Automated Post-Trade                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Trade Agreement    | Trade agreed via platforms (e.g., Bloomberg), confirmed via messaging.                | Trade terms encoded in a smart contract and executed via digital signature.               |
| 2. Trade Matching     | Matching engines (e.g., MarkitWire) verify both sides' inputs.                        | No matching required. Shared contract logic ensures alignment.                            |
| 3. Clearing           | Central Counterparty (CCP) manages risk and becomes the trade counterparty.           | Smart contracts can enforce margin and settlement logic, even without a CCP.              |
| 4. Collateral Mgmt    | Managed through messages and manual instructions.                                     | Automated margin escrow and margin calls handled by smart contract logic.                 |
| 5. Settlement         | Delayed and routed through custodians and clearing banks.                             | Instant atomic settlement triggered by smart contract on maturity/event.                  |
| 6. Reconciliation     | Involves reconciling multiple internal records; prone to mismatch.                    | Single source of truth on-chain; no reconciliation needed.                                |
| 7. Reporting          | Regulatory reports compiled and submitted from internal systems.                      | On-chain data enables real-time, immutable regulatory reporting.                          |
| 8. Lifecycle Mgmt     | Events like resets or coupon payments require manual monitoring.                      | Smart contracts manage all lifecycle events automatically.                                |
