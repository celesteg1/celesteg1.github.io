# Why Tokenise Financial Assets?

Tokenisation introduces a **new financial operating model** that solves key inefficiencies in legacy markets.

| Benefit           | Description                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transparency      | All actions (minting, transfer, burning) are recorded immutably on-chain thus creating a permanent audit trail.  |
| Automation        | Token logic is embedded in smart contracts and triggered via APIs. Settlement, coupon payments, and maturity events are automated. |
| Fractional Ownership | High-value or illiquid assets can be divided into smaller parts, enabling wider participation.                  |
| Improved Liquidity | Tokens can be transferred quickly and across platforms, reducing lock-up periods and supporting 24/7 secondary markets. |
| Interoperability  | Standardisation via models like the Common Domain Model (CDM) enables compatibility across systems.                |
| Real-Time Control | Regulators, asset managers, and institutions can monitor, approve, or restrict transactions instantly via secure APIs. |
