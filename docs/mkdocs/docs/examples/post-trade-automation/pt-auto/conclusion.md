# Why it matters

Tokenisation and post-trade automation are not futuristic ideas. They're a practical upgrade to today’s financial plumbing. By combining programmable smart contracts, legal standards like CDM, and a developer-focused API, ABC-Labs enables:

- Digitally native, legally robust financial assets
- Fully automated, transparent post-trade processes
- Lower costs, fewer intermediaries, and faster settlements
- Greater market access and liquidity

This is tokenisation done right; not as a blockchain experiment, but as an integrated platform for modern capital markets.
