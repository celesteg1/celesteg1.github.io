# Fictional Examples Overview

Use this page to browse various examples. I used the <a href="https://diataxis.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diátaxis documentation framework</a> to structure the content for each.
   
## Post-Trade Automation with Tokenisation and Blockchain

This example was created for a job interview with a fintech firm. The client wanted a focus on automation opportunities in post-trade operations, rather than blockchain for its own sake.

### Outline of docs

I've created the documents below to satisfy the requirement and keep the focus on post-trade automation:

- [**Explanation (top-level)**](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/pt-auto/introduction/): How post-trade works today and how automation maps onto it.
- [**Explanation (sub-level)**](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/token-lifecycle/introduction/): How the tokenisation workflow works (mint, burn, read, update).
- [**How-To's**](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/how-tos/how-to-mint-a-token/): Four individual How-To's as a walkthrough of each tokenisation workflow step.
- [**Reference (API)**](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/references/api/api-overview/): An outline of fake but plausible API calls to support the tokenisation workflow.
- [**Reference (Concepts/Definitions)**](/mkdocs/examples/post-trade-automation/references/glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms/): Definitions to clarify terminology for users.
- **Tutorial/Guide**: ***Not included***. But would outline process flows such as a ***"Getting Started Guide"*** or distinct A-Z post-trade process-flows such as ***"A complete guide to automate vanilla swaps post-trade"***.
- **Supporting documentation**: ***Not included***. But would outline Security, Compliance and Legal documentation.

### Role of Diátaxis

By aligning with Diátaxis, I was able to show an understanding of audience needs:

- Business/product stakeholders: Focus on post-trade automation and its benefits.
- Developers: Needed technical clarity and examples of how tokenisation works.
