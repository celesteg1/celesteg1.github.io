# Official Docs Overview

## Hands-On Prototyping

One of the first things I ask for when I join a team?  
**“Can I get access to the test system?”**

I like to dive in early: click around, follow the user journey, spot where things feel clunky, and get a real feel for how the product behaves outside the perfect-world scenario.

That hands-on approach helps me write better docs from day one. It also surfaces usability issues early, which saves time for everyone (especially developers).

Before I get too deep into system architecture or technical diagrams, I like to stay curious and keep exploring. I ask questions, test things out, and follow the product through real user journeys; not just what’s in the specs.

For me, learning is an ongoing part of the documentation process. I’m always picking up new patterns, figuring out how different pieces fit together, and making sure I understand what’s really going on; not just what it *says* is going on.

That helps me write docs that are grounded in how the product actually works and that make sense to the people using them.

Below mini-prototypes help me learn by doing. And that experience feeds directly into clear, grounded, user-friendly documentation.
