# Research and Development (R&D)

## Dr. Celeste Groenewald

Yep, I‚Äôve got a PhD in *Thinking and Reasoning* from the [Interaction Design Centre (IDC) Lab](https://idc.cs.mdx.ac.uk/about/) in the Computer Science Department at [Middlesex University](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/research/) (London, UK).

## What‚Äôs thinking and reasoning got to do with computer science?

Well, software‚Äôs pretty useless if people don‚Äôt understand how to use it ***or*** if it doesn‚Äôt align with their mental model of how things ***should*** work to reach a goal. So, I went and researched how **criminal intelligence analysts** think and reason in high-stakes environments where information is often:

- fragmented,
- missing,
- misleading, or
- ambiguous.

My work explores how people ***make sense*** of this kind of complexity and how systems can be designed to support that.

---

## Why it matters

This research informs system designers working in areas like:

- investigative software,
- decision support tools,
- and AI systems that need to reason with or explain uncertainty.

It also taught me a lot about **cognitive biases**, **mental models**, and how to design for ***real-world reasoning*** and not just ideal workflows.

---

## Why it made me a better technical writer

- üí≠ I know how people think.  
- üòµ‚Äçüí´ I know where they get stuck.  
- üí°And I write with that in mind.

Although I can dive deep into complex detail, I aim to make my documentation:

- clear,
- easy to follow,
- and genuinely helpful.

That means better onboarding, less confusion, and a smoother product experience for your users.

## Prototype in Progress

I‚Äôm currently developing a lightweight web prototype that applies this research in practice. It supports analysts in structuring their reasoning process and auto-generating reports based on their logic.

## Research & Publications

Here‚Äôs some of the work I‚Äôve published along the way:

    <h2>Reasoning in Criminal Intelligence Analysis through an Argumentation Theory-Based Framework</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Overview:</b> You‚Äôve seen those high-action films where analysts swipe data across transparent walls, connecting dots in mid-air. This research steps back from the sci-fi and digs into how criminal intelligence analysts <b>actually</b> make sense of complex, messy information and how software could genuinely support that reasoning process.     </li>
        <li><b>Skills Explored:</b> Research Methods, Sensemaking, Thinking & Reasoning, Cognitive Biases, Argumentation Schemes & Critical Questions. </li>
        <li><b>Funding:</b> My research contributed to the <a href="https://www.euprojectvalcri.org/index.html%3Fp=338.html" target="blank">VALCRI</a> research project and received funding from the European Union 7th Framework Programme under the EC Grant Agreement N¬∞ FP7-SEC-IP-608142.</li>

  <!-- Card 2: Mid-Air Hand Gestures-->

    <h2>Understanding 3D Mid-Air Hand Gestures with Interactive Surfaces and Displays: A Systematic Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
      Short Description  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Overview:</b> Ever wonder why we still use keyboards and mice? Yeah, we did too. Turns out mid-air gestures aren‚Äôt quite ready to replace them, especially when it comes to precision tasks like text editing.  Everyone had their own idea of what things like a "closed hand" or an "open hand" gesture meant, and consistency was all over the place. So, we reviewed the research; classified the gestures, checked who actually tested them, and mapped the landscape. You're welcome. </li>
        <li><b>Skills Explored:</b> Systematic Literature Review, Human Computer Interactions, 3D Gestures, Mid-Air Hand Gestures, Interaction Gestures.</li>
